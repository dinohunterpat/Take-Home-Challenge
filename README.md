# Take-Home-Challenge: Ultimate
This repository contains the answers to the take-home challenge from Springboard. The answers are comprised of 3 separate files. The first file is the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which organizes and visualizes the data to show possible trends. The second file details the metrics and parameters that will be used for testing these patterns. The third and final file is the machine learning which predicts the possible patterns and results based on the guidelines shown in the first and second file.
